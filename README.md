# PINN Method (Physics-Informed Neural Networks)

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of the **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN)** method using Python and TensorFlow. PINNs are a class of machine learning algorithms that incorporate physical laws (expressed as partial differential equations) directly into the learning process, enabling them to solve physics-based problems efficiently.

## Features
- Implementation of PINNs using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.
- Utilization of **NumPy** for data manipulation and **Matplotlib** for visualization.
- A focus on solving differential equations or modeling physical systems using deep learning.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.0+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-folder>
   ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`Untitled2.ipynb`) in your preferred editor:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Untitled2.ipynb
   ```
2. Execute the cells sequentially to:
   - Define the neural network architecture.
   - Specify the governing physical equations.
   - Train the model and visualize results.

## File Structure
- `Untitled2.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the PINN implementation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies for the project.

## Results
The notebook includes visualizations of the training process and the results obtained from the PINN model. These plots demonstrate how the network approximates solutions to the given physics-based problem.
